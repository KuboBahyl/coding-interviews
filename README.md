# Materials for coding interview

Here you can find all my preparational materials for coding interview.
I specifically applied for the Google summer internship, but the materials
are useful regardless of the company one is applying at.

## Recommended preparation plan for SWE interview
1. Choose and learn a programming language
2. Basic language operations (console, files, stream, etc.)
3. Revise data structures
4. Practice algo paradigms
5. Solve complex problems in/with limited time/options

### A few sincere tips:
- be absolutely comfortable with hashmaps, tree search/path traversals and binary search
- be aware of mutable objects in Python
- generally use hashsets, tuples and maps as much as possible
- think/talk about how the code could look better
- don't rush, even when having the best solution
- start with special cases, then write main
- drafting pseudocode is waste of time
- try to code without IDE's help
